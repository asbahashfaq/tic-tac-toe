Algorithm: 
1- TacArray = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
2- Die roll to check who goes first
3- Click event, get x,y attributes of clickboxes
4- Update TacArray using x,y attributes
5- Wait 2.5 turns (5 click events)
6- Check if row complete
7- Update score if row complete, clear board
8- Keep updating board with click events if row not complete
9- Declare tie if all boxes filled without row complete (or after 9 click events)


Plan: 
1- Make basic HTML structure for game
2- Basic css to make testing easier on webpage
3- Implement basic game functionality (inputs, wins, score)
4- Shashka - More CSS, prettify
5- Implement added functionality using JS
6- Optional: Save score in a file to retreive later?
